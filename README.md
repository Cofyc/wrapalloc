wrapalloc - Wraps up glibc's memory allocation and freeing API functions to ease dynamic tracing

Synopsis
========

    LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/wrapalloc/wrapalloc.so your_app

Description
===========

The glibc binaries shipped with most mainstream Linux distributions usually suffer from the incorrect
debuginfo generated by gcc under very aggressive optimizaton flags.

This LD_PRELOAD library wraps up the common glibc API functions for memory allocations and de-allocations
so that dynamic tracing tools like those based on systemtap can work reliably.

Building
========

    $ make
